## Fundamentals
### Programming
+ [CS50: Computer Science Courses and Programs from Harvard](https://www.edx.org/cs50) If you have never programmed before, are new to computer science, or just want something to go back to the absolute basics, this is the online course for it. Hugely famous amongst the online CS community and majority of the videos are freely available both on the platform and also YouTube. The interactive practice sessions are also (usually) free, but certification is not.

![Paid](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paid-orange)
![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)


+ [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/courses) An interactive programming platform with practice streaks, online code editor and mobile app. Good for on the go practice and has Python and AI specific learning paths. Has a premium version but at the time of writing the free tier is more than adequate to get basic programming skill practice.
![Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text-blue)
![Paid](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paid-orange)
![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)


[PyTorch Tutorials](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/) PyTorch is the main framework used for AI/ML in research. The official tutorial series is good and worth spending the time going through once you've done some basic Python practice. Check out the YouTube playlist aswell! This resource is both in the ML and Programming resource lists in this repo.
