## Fundamentals
### Programming and Data
+ [CS50: Computer Science Courses and Programs from Harvard](https://www.edx.org/cs50) If you have never programmed before, are new to computer science, or just want something to go back to the absolute basics, this is the online course for it. Hugely famous amongst the online CS community and majority of the videos are freely available both on the platform and also YouTube. The interactive practice sessions are also (usually) free, but certification is not.
![Video](https://img.shields.io/badge/Video-red)
![Paid](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paid-orange)
![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)

+ [Think Python üêç](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html) An excellent introduction (or refresher) to programming in Python and thinking like a computer scientist. Uses Jupyter Notebooks as the main method of stepping through code and has some of the best explanations around. Additionally, there are plenty of exercises and it also teaches you _how and when_ to use a "virtual assistant", or LLM, to help you code.
    ![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)
    ![Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text-blue)

+ [HyperSkill](https://hyperskill.org/courses) An interactive programming platform with practice streaks, online code editor and mobile app. Good for on the go practice and has Python and AI specific learning paths. Has a premium version but at the time of writing the free tier is more than adequate to get basic programming skill practice.
![Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text-blue)
![Paid](https://img.shields.io/badge/Paid-orange)
![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)

+ [NumPy](https://numpy.org/learn/) NumPy is a mathematical package in Python which is at the core of many machine learning and AI models as it makes handling arrays, matrices and other forms of data far easier. It's usually an immediate first step after basics of Python. Don't delay on working through some of the beginner sessions that suit you best.
![Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/Text-blue)
![Free](https://img.shields.io/badge/Free-yellow)

+ [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) pandas is a fundamental Python package for handling data structures. It's one of the most common used in ML for handling and analysing data. Learning the basic syntax of Python is always your first step, but after a while, you need to start doing some data handling before you start getting stuck with AI models. This is a short but good enough intro to get you familiar with the package.

+ [Anaconda Beginners Guide for Linux, Mac and Windows - Python Working Environments Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUZtVEDKXsk&ab_channel=PythonSimplified) Anaconda (aka Conda) is a virtual environment management toolkit. When programming in Python, especially with complex AI/ML systems, you often need to draw on lots of libraries (packages) which makes your program run. But this also means your program is dependent on these libraries being present and this varies for each type of model. Virtual environments is a way of managing these virtual environments and is essential to understand in order to make things easier for you!
